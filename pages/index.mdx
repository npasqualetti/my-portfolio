## Hey, I'm Nick.

I'm a Network Systems Engineer & Web Developer based in Cincinnati, OH. From small to medium-sized companies and even large-scale enterprises, I specialize in building IT infrastructures and optimizing websites. 

I built [StockMVP](https://www.stock-mvp.com), a financial dashboard that provides long-term value by saving you time researching your favorite stocks.

[Email](mailto:nick@nickpasqualetti.dev) me for inquiries, questions, or just to say hi! ðŸ‘‹
