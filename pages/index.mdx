## Hey, I'm Nick.

I'm a Systems Engineer / Web Developer based in Cincinnati, OH. I have worked with many small businesses to help develop their IT infrastructure and optimize their website.

I built [StockMVP](https://www.stock-mvp.com), a financial dashboard that provides long-term value by saving you time researching your favorite stocks.

[Email](mailto:nick@nickpasqualetti.dev) me for inquiries, questions, or just to say hi! ðŸ‘‹
